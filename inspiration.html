And in this blog I&#x27;ll talk a lot about the problems I had and still have. Adn today I want to talk about the people who had the greatest impact.</p><a class="text-xl text-blue-500" href="https://valwal.com">Valentin Walter</a><p>One of my dearest friends. I know him since kindergarten and we&#x27;ve always been together. In school and in private. I never were the most social person. Rather one who avoid people. In the 5th and 6th grade he was even one of the 2 friends I had. And I still appreciate that he never abandoned me. I were an awful person at that time and he is still there. And I&#x27;m very thankful that he was always there for me... If you somehow read this: Vielem Dank Vale!</p><p>He was also the one who helped me with programming and webdeveloping.</p><h2 class="text-xl mt-2">Denis Gabriel Costan</h2><p>Unfortunatly he has no website, so I cannot link him. He is one of my &quot;newer&quot; friends. But still one of my dearst friends. In 8th grade he was my neighbour in school. I still wasn&#x27;t the most social person and felt uncomfortable speaking to other people except my friends. 8th grade was also the first class without my elemntary school friends. Due to one leaving the school and the other going in the other &quot;course&quot;. We also had our complications at the beginning and i still werer a awful person at that time. Anger issues, annoying people for fun. But we still managed to become friends. He showed me the fun side of the life. And if you are seeing this: I&#x27;m sorry for everything in the past and I&#x27;m thankful for you being kind to me ;)</p><h2 class="text-xl mt-2">Zyzz</h2><p>Zyzz, a name everyone who is a little more involved with wight training has heard of. Zyzz is not a person. It is a lifestyle. To put it in a nutshell, getting a aesthetic body and enjoying youre life with parties and stuff. The Man behind this lifestsyle was Aziz Shavershian. Sadly he died even before I could start to workout... He inspired more people to go to the gym, than any other person. He was not the reason I started, but the reason I started it again and now doing it serious. My training started I think 2-3 years before it was due to me being unhappy about my weight and strength... But more about this an an other and seperate blog. Zyzz was able convice many insecure teenagers to start with the gym. But most importantly he didn&#x27;t care about other people opionion. He was thin, was being bullied and changed that. He had a goal and he reached this goal.</p></div></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/inspiration","query":{},"buildId":"SKp27byrfmejuw8LBp0zj","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
