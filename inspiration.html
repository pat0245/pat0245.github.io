And in this blog I&#x27;ll talk a lot about the problems I had and still have and today I want to talk about the people who had the greatest impact.</p><a class="text-xl text-blue-500" href="https://valwal.com">Valentin Walter</a><p>One of my dearest friends. I know him since kindergarten and we&#x27;ve always been together. In school and in private. I never were the most social person. Rather one who avoid people. In the 5th and 6th grade he was even one of the 2 friends I had. And I still appreciate that he never abandoned me. I were an awful person at that time and he is still there. And I&#x27;m very thankful that he was always there for me... If you somehow read this: Vielen Dank Vale!</p><p>He was also the one who helped me with programming and webdeveloping.</p><h2 class="text-xl mt-2">Denis Gabriel Costan</h2><p>Unfortunately he has no website, so I cannot link him. He is one of my &quot;newer&quot; friends. But still one of my dearest friends. In 8th grade he was my neighbour in school. I still wasn&#x27;t the most social person and felt uncomfortable speaking to other people except my friends. 8th grade was also the first class without my elemntary school friends. Due to one leaving the school and the other going in the other &quot;course&quot;. We also had our complications at the beginning and i still werer a awful person at that time. Anger issues, annoying people for fun. But we still managed to become friends. He showed me the fun side of the life. And if you are seeing this: I&#x27;m sorry for everything in the past and I&#x27;m thankful for you being kind to me ;)</p><h2 class="text-xl mt-2">Zyzz</h2><p>Zyzz, a name everyone who is a little more involved with wight training has heard of. Zyzz is not a person. It is a lifestyle. To put it in a nutshell, getting a aesthetic body and enjoying youre life with parties and stuff. The Man behind this lifestsyle was Aziz Shavershian. Sadly he died even before I could start to workout... He inspired more people to go to the gym, than any other person. He was not the reason I started, but the reason I started it again and now doing it serious. My training started I think 2-3 years before it was due to me being unhappy about my weight and strength... But more about this an an other and seperate blog. Zyzz was able convice many insecure teenagers to start with the gym. But most importantly he didn&#x27;t care about other people opionion. He was thin, was being bullied and changed that. He had a goal and he reached this goal.</p><h2 class="text-xl mt-2">Myself</h2><p>People who inspire you are very valuable but in the end you should be the one who inspires you. It is not easy what I am trying to tell you but I&#x27;ll try my best. You are your biggest enemy. You constantly try to beat your &quot;past self&quot; to become better, to not repeat the same mistakes, to not regret. There are many reasons why you want to be better than in the past. No human is perfect, we are evolving with every second. (if you want to learn more about my theory and opionion about the human you can visit my &quot;human blog&quot;) Our past self is constantly motivating you. If you can&#x27;t inspire yourself other people will also fail to inspire you. They can only inspire you if you want to be inspired, if you want to change something. Everything is in your mind. If you think that you are useless, let me tell you you are not. Unless you think that you are. You will automaticly do less, so stop think this crap. Your attitude is defining who you are. I might have drifted apart from what I wanted to say but remember: You are the only one who can define who you are.</p></div></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/inspiration","query":{},"buildId":"cUNLmC2UoOSjlES7yM0rX","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
