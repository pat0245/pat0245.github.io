        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">How all started</h1>
        <p className="mt-2">
          I were always a bit more interested in muscles. May it be from anime i
          watched in my childhood or a movie. I always wanted to be like these
          people. Strong and confident.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          But in reality I were the rather fat asian kid who was emotionaly
          unstable. And I mean I didn&apos;t care about that. until one time.
          And this time was during the summer break from 8th grade to 9th grade.
          I were as every year in Thailand with my family. I could&apos;t even
          do one pushup, had a shitty stamina and were fat. I think at that time
          it was 75kg at 1,68 And I had enough of being weak. There was no
          particualr reason. I just wanted a change in my life. I started with
          light workout. And as we returned my fathered bought a &quot;power
          station&quot;, like those you can see in a gym. Shortly after that we
          bought dumbbells and other gym equipment. My father also wanted to
          workout again. And since i wanted to start it was the perfect
          opportunity for him to buy these. He and I trained 2 times a week full
          body and I lost a lot of fat. Since i also grew I think it was 62kg on
          1,75m. I got more strength and lost weight. At some times my reason to
          workout was to impress a girl. We continued our workout until my
          father, couldn&apos;t due to his eyes. For a year he wasn&apos;t
          allowed tp lift weights and at the end he lost a lot of eyesight.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          I continued th workout for 2 months alone, but after that I lost my
          motivation and questioned, why am I doing this...the girl I wanted to
          impress moved away and I lost motivation. I didn&apos;t trained
          properly for 1 year. Sometimes I got a bit motivation and did
          Something with a dumbbel in my room but that&apos;s everything. Then
          our workout room was flood with water and the room was not usable for
          almost 1 year. But since I didn&apos;t trained I didn&apos;t care. It
          was a boring life for 7months. I almost live alone. Due to my
          grandmothers condition(more about this maybe in another blog.) and my
          parents moved to her house, while I remained alone in the old house.
          My parents came for lunch and dinner and then left again for my
          grandmother. I had a quiet and boring life for some months, or was it
          more than a year? Due to the lockdown I were completely alone.
          Couldn&apos;t meet with friends and no real family. Many other people
          would say that it was the perfect live. Wake up, eat, play games,
          learn a bit for school and play more games. But if I&apos;m being
          honest it was hell. It was an interesting experience but I don&apos;t
          want it anymore. Too much time alone is not good. And I&apos;m still
          fighting with some of the problems you get.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          In the same Week, were I turned 17 I moved to my parents again and
          started to workout a bit. After 2 weeks I were at the point I were
          before I took the break. And I have never felt better before than
          being in shape again. I continued to workout and even workout more and
          more serious than ever. And all this while I were in school. You have
          enough time to train and to learn. Even going out with friends was
          possible. You just need a good and most important a schedule which is
          just for you, were you plan everything. And If you are able to not do
          everything it is okay. There are cheatdays, or days without
          motivation. And they are completely normal.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-xl  mt-2">
          Just do not give up on yourself!!
        </p>
        <p>
          This goes for everything, a life schedule or a gym schedule.
          Don&apos;t give up.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-bold text-xl mt-2">Why am I training now</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Now my motivation is to workout for my self. I want to see, what my
          body is capable to become. But I don&apos;t want to do too much. Now
          there is someone who I want to impress again. But I&apos;m doing it
          mostly for myself now. Also it is a great way to kill time and to do a
          break from working. If Work for too long, you should move youre body a
          bit.And you should also do this. If you&apos;re not 100% behind youre
          thought you won&apos;be able to achive youre goals.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-2 font-bold text-lg">Thank you for listening</h2>
