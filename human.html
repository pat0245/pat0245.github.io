I am neither an expert nor have I read or learned much about the human but here I&#x27;m trying to talk about human problems and stuff.</p><h2 class="text-xl pt-2 pb-2 font-bold">Evolving and Revolving(5th August 2022)</h2><p>The human is a very unique thing on earth. We somehow evolved from the animals and to this very day we are still evolving. In fact we are constantly evolving. Not our physical appearance but our mind is changing. But we have to differ betweem two cases of change. Evolving and Revolving. When we Revolve we do change, but only for a short time. For example it is the urge to go to the gym for physical change. But in the end you do it for a short time and after that you are the same. This action goes by motivation. Motvation is good but it will not last forever. To evolve one has to chnage this motivation into discipline. Evolving is the change forever. There is no way back after you have evolved. Revolving is a common &quot;problem&quot; among the human. We want to be better and we are trying to change as hard as possible. But in the end this motivation will go away. And you have to use energy for your goals. Many people will stop chasing their goals in this moment. But if you really want to achieve it you have to use energy. No one said it would be easy. In fact it is hard... very hard. But if you are able to inspire yourself you will be the person who always wanted to be.</p><h2 class="text-xl pt-2 pb-2 font-bold">Love (8th August 2022)</h2><p>One of the most complicated feelings is love. Many animals &quot;use&quot; any partner to &quot;reproduce&quot; their kind. We humans on the other hand used to search for our partner, which whom we want to spend our whole life and with whom we wanted to &quot;make&quot; our descendants. I used the term &quot;used to search&quot; on purpose beacause these kind of releationships are very rare nowadays. We used to find our &quot;better half&quot; and even when they fought. They always found a way to fix the releationships. I am not an expert in this territory, since I weren&#x27;t in a love releationship yet. But to me it seems that many couples aren&#x27;t fighting for their releationship. I don&#x27;t want to bad talk some couples. There are still some exceptions. But sadly those are very rare. Now lets talk about love in general. It is very difficult to describe. And every human is feeling it in a different way. For me it is mostly a feeling in the stomache. Many people know it as butterflys in one&#x27;s stomache. At the same time it is a horrible and a good feeling. But these &quot;butterflys&quot; are getting less with the time you spend with the this &quot;special&quot; person. Love has it good and bad sides. It is able to grant you more motivation and strength. But most importantly it is able to get you happines and comfort. On the other hand we have a state after one has lost their love. &quot;Heartbroken&quot;. The intensity of this feeling can differ. But I would that emptyness is a good way to describe it. People are dealing with this differently and there is no generall cure for it... Love is very dangerous. It is able to change humans and force to do bad stuff. But on the other hand it is beautiful. It can change humans in the positive way and let them do things, which were impossible for them before.</p></div></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/human","query":{},"buildId":"YqFPiC-e5ZKNkt05o9wQr","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
