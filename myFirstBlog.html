Born on 2nd April 2005 in the south of Germany.</p><p>Recently I were thinking pretty much about my life and prior decisions I made. The conclusion I made was that I&#x27;have wasted a lot of time doing nothing and with that I mean nothing. Scrolling everyday many hours through Tik Tok or other social media. Not doing anything for school or my future.</p><p>But I want to change that from now on. Currently I have a short school break.

I know easier said than done. But I am Serious. &quot;When it feels scary to jump in, that is exactly when you to jump.

And I want to live after this thought...</p></div></section></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/myFirstBlog","query":{},"buildId":"Vb14A0rGHmM7iX84ewb6h","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
