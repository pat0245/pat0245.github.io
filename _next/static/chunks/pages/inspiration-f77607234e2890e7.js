He was not the reason I started, but the reason I started it again and now doing it serious. My training started I think 2-3 years before it was due to me being unhappy about my weight and strength... But more about this an an other and seperate blog.

If you see someone with a really expensive car at a gas station, do you think that they went to college and studied something? No, this is mostly the last thing you would think. Rich dad or something illegal/ uncommon would be your first thought. And it is true. If you want to have lots of money, getting a 9-5 job is one of the worst things to do. Yeah if you invest the money you have lots of it when you are old... but one question, would you rather drive your expensive car at 65 or at 25? Another thing is if you work a 9-5 job you won't have much time for your family.
